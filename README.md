# Smart-Sales-Insights-with-Tableau-MySQL
Analyzed sales data using MySQL and created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to visualize key metrics such as revenue, profit, and regional performance. This project enhanced my skills in data analysis, SQL, and business intelligence reporting.
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data using MySQL and Tableau. I extracted and cleaned the dataset using MySQL to identify key business metrics such as total revenue, profit margins, sales by region, and product performance. The data was then imported into Tableau, where I built an interactive dashboard featuring KPIs, bar charts, line graphs, and maps to enable easy exploration of sales trends. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data manipulation, SQL queries, and business intelligence tools. It was a great learning experience, and I'm now working on more advanced visualizations to improve performance tracking and decision-making.
